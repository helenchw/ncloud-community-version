# SUPPORT

## How to get support for project issues?

First, make sure you go through the documentation under 'docs/' and 'README.md' for an answer to your question.

If you cannot find an answer to your question and your question is not security-related, consider opening an issue to raise your question.
Make sure you describe your situation with necessary technical information (e.g., operating system platform, software and compiler version) in your issue.
Be prepared to perform additional check and supply extra information upon maintainers' requests.

Please observe the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when requesting support from the project team.

If your question is security-related, please follow the guideline [here](SECURITY.md).

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
