# Maintainers

## How to become a maintainer

The projectâ€™s maintainers will, from time-to-time, consider promoting a contributor as a maintainer, based on the following criteria:

- Demonstrated track record of PR reviews (both quality and quantity of reviews)
- Demonstrated thought leadership in the project
- Demonstrated shepherding of project work and contributors

- An existing maintainer can nominate a contributor by creating a pull request to the maintainers file. Nomination approval requires a majority approval from the existing Maintainers. Once approved, an existing maintainer merge the pull request and adds the nominated contributor to the maintainers group.

Project maintainers may be removed by explicit resignation, for prolonged inactivity (e.g. 6 or more months with no review comments), or for some infraction of the code of conduct or by consistently demonstrating poor judgement. A proposed removal also requires a majority approval. A maintainer removed for inactivity should be restored following a sustained resumption of contributions and reviews (a month or more) demonstrating a renewed commitment to the project.
